# Hi, I'm Luthfi Pratama ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m a UI/UX designer passionate about creating user-friendly and visually appealing experiences. I specialize in crafting intuitive designs and bringing them to life using **Figma** and **Framer**. Currently, Iâ€™m having a blast building my portfolio and exploring new ways to make designs interactive and engaging.

## Skills
- **Design Tools**: Figma, Framer
- **Prototyping**: Interactive prototypes, user flows, and wireframes
- **Design Focus**: UI/UX, responsive design, and visual storytelling

## Featured Projects
- [My Portfolio](#) â€“ A personal portfolio built with Framer to showcase my design work.
- [Hospet Dashboard Revamp](#) - A redesign of a dashboard focus on tracking pet health.
- [BuyCar Website Revamp](#) â€“ A redesign of a vehicle sales platform focused on simplicity and usability.

## Fun Fact
Iâ€™m a huge fan of body building and maybe it's not related at all, but sometimes I feel inspired after that ðŸ’ª
